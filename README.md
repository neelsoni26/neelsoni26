## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm currently pursuing my Master's at the University of Guelph, where I focus on:

- 🐍 **Penetration Testing & Exploit Development**
- 🧠 **Malware Analysis & Threat Intelligence**
- 🔐 **Cryptography & Secure Protocols**
- 🤖 **AI/ML for Malware Detection & Anomaly Detection**

I believe in hands-on learning, breaking things in labs before they get broken in the wild. I’m also a chapter leader for the [OWASP WWW Chapter – University of Guelph](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-university-of-guelph/), where I organize CTFs, talks, and workshops to foster a secure-by-default mindset.

## 🚀 Projects

Here are a few highlights from my recent and ongoing work:

- 🧠 **Hybrid Malware Classification using Static and Dynamic Features**
  _Academic Project – CIS-6670 (ST: Cybersecurity)_
  Combines static analysis (EMBER v2) and dynamic behavior (CIC-MalMem 2022) for improved malware detection. Uses machine learning models optimized with SHAP for interpretability.
  Upgradation of the static analysis of PE files with the EMBER 2018 V2 dataset.
  Tools: Python 3.10, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, LightGBM, MLP, XGBoost, SHAP, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook.

- 🤖 **AI Multi Agent**
  An AI-powered multi-agent system designed to automate literature reviews from arXiv. Uses OpenAI models to streamline research tasks by summarizing papers and generating coherent reviews.
  Tools: Python 3.12, Microsoft's AutoGen, OpenAI API, `arxiv` library.

- 🧠 **AI-Based Malware Detection with Explainable AI**
  Using static analysis of PE files with the EMBER 2018 V2 dataset and a deep learning model in Keras.  
  Integrating SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret malware classification decisions.  
  Tools: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, SHAP, scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook.

- 🔬 [**APT Detection using ML & Deep Learning**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13408) — *arXiv published research*  
  Explored opcode-based classification of malware using n-gram ML models and CNNs on static code.  
  Compared handcrafted features with deep models for malware classification performance.

- 🛠️ **Penetration Testing Labs**  
  Built buffer overflow exploits, performed privilege escalation, and post-exploitation with Metasploit.  
  Hands-on with OpenVAS, Nessus, Nmap scripting, and Windows/Linux targets.

- 🔐 **Cryptography with Python + OpenSSL**  
  Designed secure communication systems using AES (CBC/GCM), RSA, SHA-256, and digital signatures.  
  Explored vulnerabilities like key reuse and padding oracle.

- 📱 **Biometric Anomaly Detection**  
  Built a swiping-behavior-based user profiling system using the Touchalytics dataset and scikit-learn.  
  Evaluated classification robustness and feature engineering for behavioral authentication.

- 🕵️‍♂️ **Web Application Security**  
  Performed XSS, CSRF, and SQL Injection attacks on lab applications.  
  Demonstrated session hijacking, mitigation, and crafted custom payloads.
